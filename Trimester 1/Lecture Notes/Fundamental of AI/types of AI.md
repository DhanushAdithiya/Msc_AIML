# Types of AI
AI can be classified into two different categories:
## Bases on Capabilities
### Narrow AI
This is the only type of AI that exists today. This is also known as **Weak AI** It can only be trained to perform a single task.

### General AI
Also known as **Strong AI**. It is only a theoretical concept. This can use previous learnings and skills to perform new tasks without the need for a human being to train the underlying model.

### Super AI
Super AI is commonly referred to as artificial superintelligence and, like AGI, is strictly theoretical. If ever realized, Super AI would think, reason, learn, make judgements and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings.

The applications possessing Super AI capabilities will have evolved beyond the point of understanding human sentiments and experiences to feel emotions, have needs and possess beliefs and desires of their own.

## Bases on Functionality
### Reactive Machine
Reactive machines are AI systems with no memory and are designed to perform a very specific task. Since they canâ€™t recollect previous outcomes or decisions, they only work with presently available data. Reactive AI stems from statistical math and can analyze vast amounts of data to produce a seemingly intelligent output. Example - IBM Deep Blue

### Limited Memory
### Theory of Mind
### Self Aware AI
