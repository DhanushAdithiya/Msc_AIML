# Introduction to AI
## What is AI
There are 4 main approaches to AI

### Acting Humanly - The Turing Test
**Turing Test** proposed by Alan Turing was designed to proved a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence A computer passes the test if a human interogater after posing some written questions is ot able to tell whether the answers were given by a human or a computer. 

The computer would need the following:
- NLP - to enable communication.
- knowledge representation - to store what it knows.
- automated reasoning - to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- machine learning - to adapt to new cicumstances.

There is an extension of to turing test called the **Total Turing Test** which requires a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities and to pass objects "through the hatch". The computer would additionally need computer vision and robotics to pass this test.

### Thinking Humanly - Cognitive Modeling 
If we say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. The field of cognitive science brigns toether computer models form AI and experimentintal techniques from psychology to construce precise and testable theories of the human mind.

### Thinking Rationally - The laws of thought

### Acting Rationally - The rational agent approach
An agent is something that acts. A Rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outomeor, when there is uncertaininty, the best expected solution. Making corrent inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one wayu to act rationall yis to reason logicallt ot the conclusion that a given action will achieve ones's goals and then to act on that conclusion.


## Foundations of AI
There are some of the disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to AI.

### Philosophy
AI takes the following ideas from philosphy:

- Can formal rules bt used to draw valid conclusions?
    Aristotle was the first to formulate the set of laws that goven the rational parts of the mind. Given initial premise with the help of the informal syllogims he developed one was able to generate conclusions mechanically.

- How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
- Where does knowledge form?
- How does knowledge lead to action?


### Mathematics
Mathematics is requried to take the leap for formal science from fundamental ideas of AI that was laid down my philisophy

### Economics
- How should we make decisions so as to maximize playoff
- How should we do this wen other may not go along?
- How should we do this when the playoff may be far in the future?

### Neuroscience
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system. This knowlegde of how the brain works directly helps the development of AI

### Psychology
Psychology helps answer the rational questions regarding how humans think.

### Computer Engineering
How can we build an efficient computer?
For AI to succeed, we need two things:

Intelligence and artifact.

The computer has been the artifact of the choice.

### Control Theory and Cybernetics
Control theory and cybernetics deals with the self controlling machine. Modern control theory has its goal to design the system that maximize an objective function overtime. This roughly match the AI view: designing system that behave optimally.

### Linguistics
Language is directly related to thought. Modern linguistics and AI, were born at about the same time and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing.
