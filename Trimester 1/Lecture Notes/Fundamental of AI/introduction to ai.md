# Introduction to AI
## What is AI
There are 4 main approaches to AI

### Acting Humanly - The Turing Test
**Turing Test** proposed by Alan Turing was designed to proved a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence A computer passes the test if a human interogater after posing some written questions is ot able to tell whether the answers were given by a human or a computer. 

The computer would need the following:
- NLP - to enable communication.
- knowledge representation - to store what it knows.
- automated reasoning - to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- machine learning - to adapt to new cicumstances.

There is an extension of to turing test called the **Total Turing Test** which requires a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities and to pass objects "through the hatch". The computer would additionally need computer vision and robotics to pass this test.

### Thinking Humanly - Cognitive Modeling 
If we say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. The field of cognitive science brigns toether computer models form AI and experimentintal techniques from psychology to construce precise and testable theories of the human mind.

### Thinking Rationally - The laws of thought

### Acting Rationally - The rational agent approach
An agent is something that acts. A Rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outomeor, when there is uncertaininty, the best expected solution. Making corrent inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one wayu to act rationall yis to reason logicallt ot the conclusion that a given action will achieve ones's goals and then to act on that conclusion.


## Foundations of AI
There are some of the disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to AI.

### Philosophy
### Mathematics
### Economics
### Neuroscience
### Psychology
### Computer Engineering
### Control Theory and Cybernetics
### Linguistics
