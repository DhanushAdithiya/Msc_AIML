# Measures of Central Tendency
Statistical constants which enable us to comprehend in a single effort the significance of the whole. They give us the idea about the concentration of the values in the central part of the distribution.

## Characteristics of a good avergae
- It should be easy to understand
- It should be simple to compute
- It should take into account all the observations
- It shoudl be rigidly defined
- Capable of further algebraic treatment
- Sampling stability
- Should not be affected by outliers

The following are the five measures of central tendency:
## Arithmetic Mean
It is the sum of all the observations divided by the number of observations. 
### Individual Freq

### Freq Distribution

### Continuous Fre

If the values of x or f are large the calcuation of mean can be reduced by taking derivations of the given values form any point 'A'.

## Median
Median is the value of the variable which dividese it into two equal parts. It is a positional Average.

### Ungrouped Values
In case of ungrouped values, median is the middle most value after sorting in ascending order, (incase of odd median is N/2 and incase of even it is N/2 + 1th value, where N is the total number of values).

### Group data

### Continuous Freq Distribution
In this case then class corresponding to the c.f just greater than N/2 iscalled the median class and the value of median is obtained by:

## Mode 
Mode is the value that occurs the most frequent

In the case of both ungrouped and grouped data mode can be identified visually by looking at the data.
