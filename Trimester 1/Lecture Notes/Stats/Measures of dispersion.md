# Measures of dispersion
We study dispersion to have an idea abotu the homogenity of the distribution. Measures of dispersion give us the how each observation of the group varies from the mean or the average score.

The Following are the measures of dispersion:
## Range
It is the difference between the largest and the smallest values of the observation.

RANGE = L - S
L = Largest Value
S = Smallest Value

## Standard Deviation
Standard deviation mesaures how much each observation in the data deviates from the mean of the data.
It is the positive square root of the arithemetic mean of the squares of the deviations of the given values form their arithmetic mean.
