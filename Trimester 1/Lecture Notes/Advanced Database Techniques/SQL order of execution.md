An SQL query comprises of various clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUPBY, HAVING, and ORDERBY clauses. Each clause has a specific role in the query. Letâ€™s understand each of them briefly.

Getting Data (FROM/JOIN)
Row Filter (WHERE)
Grouping (GROUP BY)
Group Filter (HAVING)
Return Expression (SELECT)
Order & Paging (ORDER BY & LIMIT/OFFSET)
